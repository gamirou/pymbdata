# Pymbdata

A toy library that includes some complex data types seen in mathematics, engineering and statistics.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Numpy is used in the matrix, but it will be automatically installed when you install pymbdata.

### Installing

To install the library you need to have PIP installed

Installing the library

```
pip install pymbdata
```

To import it in a python script

```
import pymb
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
